I took part in my first CTF a few days ago. Though I could solve only one problem, it was fun trying out different approaches to extract hidden information. I feel being part of this club will help me learn and explore this field more as a team and contribute to widen interest in this field in the institute.    

## Task 1
It was a very "creative problem"

The answer is in [here](task1/answer.txt)

## Task 2
Had to write some code to solve the problems. First extracted the equations as strings into [easy.txt](task2/easy.txt) using the [decode.py](task2/decode.py) script. The used the [solve.py](task2/solve.py) script to solve each equation individually.

The answers are in [here](task2/answers.txt)
